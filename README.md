Different codes for arduino(which includes code for wifi connection, sensors ) can be found inside the arduino sub folder, names of the files are self explanatory.

As of now, code for Wifi connection works, standalone code for temp sensor works, code for temp sensor work when combined with wifi code , standalone code for pulse oximeter sensor works but won't work when combined with code for wifi.
